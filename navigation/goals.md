* Very usful for creating discriptions on products and items
* Did JSON page for lesson
* help look over all other parts of lesson for errors
* I likes Kush's lesson because it taught me how to do math
* Math is very very usful for math class 
* So learning how to code math let's me do math better
<br/> <br/>
* In our group lesson on organizing data and different types of variables, I found the information extremely useful for creating descriptions of products and items. We worked on a JSON page, which helped us understand how to structure data effectively. I also helped review other parts of the lesson for errors to ensure everything was accurate.

* I particularly enjoyed Kush's lesson because it taught me how to apply math in a coding context. Understanding how to code mathematical concepts enhances my math skills, making it easier for me to tackle problems in math class.

* Overall, all the concepts we learned, especially from Kush's lesson, will be valuable for me in the future. I believe these skills will help me throughout my life.
