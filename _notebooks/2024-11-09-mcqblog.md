The practice quiz helped me understand key computer science concepts like data representation, algorithms, and data structures. I learned that itâ€™s important to think critically about how computers work and how problems can be solved using different methods. The quiz showed me which topics I understand well and which areas need more practice.



Looking back at the quiz the main thing I struggled with was fully reading and comprehnding the questions which led to me missing important details and getting the wrong answer. I also struggled with questions on loops specifically nested loops.

My main correction for nested loops was a small error in the way I was viewing the loops. After realizing this when going over my answers I now understand it better.
