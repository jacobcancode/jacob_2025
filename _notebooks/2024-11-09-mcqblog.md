The practice quiz helped me understand key computer science concepts like data representation, algorithms, and data structures. I learned that itâ€™s important to think critically about how computers work and how problems can be solved using different methods. The quiz showed me which topics I understand well and which areas need more practice.

Looking back at the quiz the main thing I struggled with was fully reading and comprehnding the questions which led to me missing important details and getting the wrong answer. I also struggled with questions on loops specifically nested loops. Aditionaly I need to work on my list questions because I got all of them wrong

My main correction for nested loops was a small error in the way I was viewing the loops. After realizing this when going over my answers I now understand it better. For lists after reviewing the questions and doing some research online I realized my mistake was I was skipping over crutial steps in the list.
