    "## 1. What is a hex color code? What are some examples?\n",
    "A hex color code is a six-digit code that represents a color using numbers 0–9 and letters A–F. It starts with `#`. Each pair of digits represents the Red, Green, and Blue (RGB) values.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples**:\n",
    "- `#FF0000` → Red\n",
    "- `#00FF00` → Green\n",
    "- `#0000FF` → Blue\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. What is Base64 and how is it used with images?\n",
    "Base64 is a method of encoding binary data (like images) into text. It allows images to be safely transmitted or embedded into text files like HTML, CSS, and emails.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use with images**:\n",
    "Images can be converted into Base64 text and directly embedded into a webpage without needing a separate image file.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Why might you use Base64 instead of a regular image file?\n",
    "You might use Base64 if:\n",
    "- You want to send images inside emails without attachments.\n",
    "- You want faster small-image loading (like icons or logos) in websites.\n",
    "- You need to avoid extra file requests for performance.\n"

    "- Each pixel’s color is stored using RGB (Red, Green, Blue) values.\n",
    "- When the notebook runs `<img src=`, it reads the file and shows it by decoding the stored pixel data.\n"
