# Building a Space for Readers: My Journey with the Book Site Project

As book lovers, we all know how important it is to have a space where we can discover, discuss, and organize our reading journey. That's exactly what our site is all about: creating a place where readers can foster and strengthen their love for books.

In this project, I had the chance to contribute in several ways, and I’d love to share my experience with you. Let me take you through some of the main features I worked on.

## **1. Front-End Theme Work**

One of the first things I worked on was helping to shape the look and feel of the site. This meant working on the theme, ensuring that the design was clean, user-friendly, and matched the overall vibe of a space meant for readers. Whether it was adjusting colors, fonts, or layout, my goal was to make the site easy to navigate so users could focus on what matters: the books!

## **2. Building the Login System**

A major part of the site was the login system. This feature was essential because we wanted users to be able to sign in and track their reading progress. Initially, I worked on a basic login, but I quickly realized there was more we could do. We wanted the majority of the site’s features to be hidden until a user logged in, creating a more personalized experience.

Through some careful code structure, I improved the login system so users could access their personal reading lists and manage their favorite books once they logged in.

## **3. Creating the Static API for Books**

Once the basic features were in place, I shifted focus to the books themselves. We wanted a way to display books based on their genre, so I created a static API. This API allowed us to show a list of books in different categories, like Mystery, Fantasy, or Romance, with basic details like title, author, and genre.

## **4. Upgrading to a Dynamic API with Database Support**

The next step was to make the API more dynamic and interactive. Instead of just showing static data, I connected the site to a database. This allowed users to add books to a reading list with details like the book’s title, author, and genre, and the backend would automatically update with these changes.

Not only could users add books to their lists, but they could also delete them if they decided to remove something from their reading collection. This was a fun feature to build because it made the site feel more alive, giving users a way to manage their reading preferences directly.

## **5. Enhancing the Login System with Cookies**

To make the user experience even smoother, I began working on a cookie system. The idea behind this was to save login information so that users wouldn’t have to log in every time they visited the site. This small change would make returning to the site much easier and more convenient.

## Conclusion

This project has been an incredible learning experience for me. From working on the front-end theme to building a dynamic backend with a database, I’ve been able to contribute to something that can really help readers manage and enjoy their books.

I’m excited about how the site is shaping up, and I’m proud of the features I’ve worked on—whether it’s improving the login system, creating an API to manage reading lists, or starting the groundwork for a smoother user experience with cookies. Every step has helped bring us closer to building a space where readers can come together, share, and most importantly, enjoy their books!
